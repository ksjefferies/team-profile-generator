## Description:  

The Team Profile Generator (TPG) is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so the application contains the ability to perform a unit test for every part of the code and ensure that it passes each test.

-------
## Objectives:
```

- TPG is a command-line application that accepts user input to enter all data.
- When the manager starts the information, they will need to answer the default questions:
    * Name (default)
    * Employee ID (default)
    * Email Address (default)
    * Office Number (Manager question only)
- After answering the previous questions, the manager is given the option to
    * Add an Engineer
    * Add an Intern
    * Finish Building Team
- Selecting Engineer will require all the original default questions plus this additional:
    * GitHub username (Engineer only)
- Selecting Intern will require the default questions plus this additional
    * School name (Intern only)
- Selecting Finish Building Team
    * Will push all data and generate a HTML and exit application
    
```
